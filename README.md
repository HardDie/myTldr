# myTldr
Lightweight tldr client.<br>
The same colors and help file parsing mechanism as in the original python script have been used.<br>
This client allows you to create your own separated from main repository help files.<br>
The entire cache is stored in one file ```~/.cache/tldr/pages.db```<br>

# My local pages you can find:
